rsnapshot (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    hourly/daily/weekly/monthly default retains are now alpha/beta/gamma/delta.
    If you want to keep your backup history, you must rename all your
    already generated directories in your snapshot_root directory;
    you can use the helper script /usr/share/doc/rsnapshot/rename_retains.sh.
    It is also possible to use the previous names in /etc/rsnapshot.conf and
    changes them in your cron jobs.

rsnapshot (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Until now, the Debian package of rsnapshot included a patch to ensure
    backward compatibility with pre-1.2 configuration files (see below). This
    patch has been dropped in this release, and all users are now forced to
    upgrade their configuration files to the 1.2 format. Please see the UPGRADE
    section from /usr/share/doc/rsnapshot/README.Debian if you are still using
    1.1.x configuration files.

rsnapshot (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    In this release the default rsync long_args have changed, --relative and
    --delete-excluded have been added. --relative will affect the destination
    of the backup points. However your current config will continue to work in
    a compatibility mode where --relative is not used. To benefit of all new
    features and bugfixes you have to change your config file. Be sure to read
    /usr/share/doc/rsnapshot/README.Debian
