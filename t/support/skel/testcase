# Write here in brief, what you want to check!
#

# your code follows here
 
# there are MACROS, which should aways be used:
# @TEST@ you're always referencing your testsuite-directory
#   in a test-file it could look like this:
#   ok(0 == rsnapshot("-c @TEST@/cmd-post_pre-exec/conf/pre-false-post-false.conf hourly"));
# @SNAP@ always references a possible snapshot-root
#   in the configuration-file this could be one line:
#   snapshot_root		@SNAP@
# @TEMP@ the template directory. Use this as your backup-source
#   in the configuration-file this could be one line:
#   backup	@TEMP@		localhost
#
# there are of course other MACROS, too. check them out:
#  $> grep AC_SUBST configure.ac
# The first parameter is always the macro_name which gets replaced

#here is some pseudo-code to give you a hint, how your tests could look like
ok(0 == rsnapshot("-c @TEST@/cmd-post_pre-exec/conf/pre-false-post-false.conf hourly"));

# you can even skip tests
SKIP: {
	if($condition){
		skip("Cant SSH with \"$ssh_test\"", 1);

	ok(!rsnapshot("-c @TEST@/ssh_args/conf/ssh_args.conf hourly"), "ssh_args parsed");
