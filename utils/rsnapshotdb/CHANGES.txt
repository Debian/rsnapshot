Cleaned up code and removed password requirement for ssh server connection.

Removed requirement of Net::SSH::Perl

Speed optimization done with remote database dump and gzip compression before transfering file locally.

1/4/05

Switched to XML-based configuration file, and requirement of Net::SSH::Perl for more sophisticated ssh handling of database backups.

Speed issue of remote database dumps should be slightly if not vastly more optimized in this release. Database tables were locking during a remote backup, which took down the web site temporarily ( ~ 30 mins on one forum I own).
