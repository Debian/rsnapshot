TODO LIST:

- as suggested by r00t in #bash, add option to split on tables instead of db. ie: ./hostname/database/table.tar.gz
- enable split | gzip to get in under isp radar (cpu resource limits with I/O on large db's).
- thoroughly test with postgresql, mysql on Linux only testing so far.


10/22/06
DONE - remove requirement for database password to be present in xml config file.


8/16/06
DONE - changed log file to 0600 permissions

1/22/06
DONE - Thoroughly test rewrite using ssh keys and tunneling.
DONE - Optimize code efficiency, main reason I'm throwing this out on the web as GPL :-)

- Decide whether to stop, or continue on errors/connectivity issues. Possibly throw an email/SMS at someone. Problem because assumption is that you're db's are being archived without error.

DONE - remove support for unencrypted SSH passwords in rsnapshotDB.conf, should be supported with ssh keys instead.
